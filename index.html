            <h5 align="center">      My Project </h5> </br>
            <p align="center">     I'm Barbie Jean Nemiaga, 19 years old. I live in Babag 2 Lapu-Lapu City with my parents. I also have a sibling whose name is KC Nemiaga. We may not that close but one thing is for sure and that is we love each other and willing to help one another. </p></br>

<p align="center"> When I was a kid, I was forbidden to play around and enjoy my life. I didn't have fun. As I get older, my personality changed, I become too childish and make things that can make me happy that I never experienced when I was a kid. I create funny moments, I smiled, I was enjoying.</p><br>

<p align="center"> I  studied in Tungasan Elementary school when I was young. I then proceed to High School in Babag National High School. And now I'm currently studying in Lapu-Lapu City College  </p> </br>

<p align="center">My hobbies are playing soccer, badminton and singing. Every lyrics and rhythm gives me relaxation as well as happiness. Doing this things makes me happy. I don't need anybody just to be happy because I can be happy on my own company.</p></br>
